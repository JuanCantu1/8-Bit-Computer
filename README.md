## Project Name: 8-Bit Computer

### Introduction:
Welcome to the 8-Bit Computer project! This repository hosts the source code, schematics, and documentation for building a fully-functional 8-bit computer system from scratch. One of the fundamental components of this computer is the clock circuit, which serves as the heartbeat of the system, regulating its operations.

### Clock Design:
The clock is an indispensable component of the computer architecture. In this project, we have meticulously designed a versatile clock with the capability to operate in two distinct modes: Monostable and Astable.

#### Monostable Mode:
In the Monostable mode, the clock cycle is manually triggered using a tactile button. With each press of the button, a clock cycle is initiated, synchronizing the system's activities seamlessly.

#### Astable Mode:
Contrastingly, the Astable mode offers dynamic frequency control. By employing a potentiometer, the frequency of the clock signal can be precisely adjusted, allowing for flexible timing configurations tailored to specific computational needs.

### Schematic:
Below is the schematic representation of the clock circuit:

### Circuit Implementation:
Below is the schematic built physically on a breadboard.
