## 8-Bit Computer Project

### Introduction: Welcome to the 8-Bit Computer project! Within this repository lies the culmination of my expertise in computer architecture, digital logic design, and assembly language programming. Here, you'll find everything you need to construct a fully-functional 8-bit computer system from the ground up, including meticulously crafted source code, detailed schematics, and comprehensive documentation. This project not only showcases my proficiency in these domains but also serves as a testament to my dedication to excellence and innovation in the realm of computing.

### Clock Design:
The clock is an indispensable component of the computer architecture. In this project, we have meticulously designed a versatile clock with the capability to operate in two distinct modes: Monostable and Astable.

#### Monostable Mode:
In the Monostable mode, the clock cycle is manually triggered using a tactile button. With each press of the button, a clock cycle is initiated, synchronizing the system's activities seamlessly.

#### Astable Mode:
Contrastingly, the Astable mode offers dynamic frequency control. By employing a potentiometer, the frequency of the clock signal can be precisely adjusted, allowing for flexible timing configurations tailored to specific computational needs.

### Schematic:
Below is the schematic representation of the clock circuit:
